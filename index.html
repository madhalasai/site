      <h2>A Letter for you</h2>
      <p>
        love u jaanu. i'm not good at this at all but i'm learning so i can give my love the proper appreciation and love you deserve. 
        you make me so happy my dudu. ur right, we will work it out we will figure it out but i want u to know that to me u are everything and more. 
        i'm so excited to see you.<br><br>
        yk i'm going to leave a lot to say for when i see you and the other gifts i have (hint hint) but this is because I want you to know I will always (metaphorically) try to speak your language. 
        to me you are the most important thing in the world. ik we struggle with communication at times but we will work on it and make it through. 
        i'm in no way a coder nor am i experienced with websites or these kind of things. this shit was hard and i appreciate you so so SO much more right now. 
        with that being said, you make me a better person and i'm learning more from you and with you. i always want to speak your language. 
        i know this might not seem like a super big deal to you but i wanted to do something and take time and effort to learn about my dudus world of coding and vercel and what not and create this so dudu knows how much his bubu ADORES him. 
        i love you yaar. hope u enjoyed this!!<br><br>
        ps: you are my safe place, my sunshine, my favorite everything. thank you for being the best boyfriend ever. ❤️
